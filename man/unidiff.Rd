\title{
  Fitting Log-Multiplicative Uniform Difference/Layer Effect Model
}
\description{
  \code{unidiff} fits the log-multiplicative uniform difference model (UNIDIFF,
  see Erikson & Goldthorpe, 1992), also called the log-multiplicative layer effect model (Xie, 1992).
}
\usage{
unidiff(tab, diagonal = c("included", "excluded", "only"),
        constrain = "auto", family = poisson,
        tolerance = 1e-06, iterMax = 5000,
        trace = FALSE, verbose = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{tab}{a three-way table, or an object (such as a matrix) that can be coerced into a table;
      if present, dimensions above three will be collapsed as appropriate.}
  \item{diagonal}{\code{included} fits the standard model with full two-way interaction;
      \code{excluded} adds to this model diagonal-specific parameters for each years, effectively
      removing the influence of diagonal cells on the layer coefficients; \code{only} fits a model
      without the full two-way interaction, where only diagonal parameters are affected by the layer
      effect (see \dQuote{Details} below).}
  \item{constrain}{(non-eliminated) coefficients to constrain, specified by a regular expression,
      a numeric vector of indices, a logical vector, a character vector of names, or "[?]" to
      select from a Tk dialog. The default constrains to 0 the first layer parameter and
      interaction coefficients for the first row and column of the table.}
  \item{check}{passed to \code{\link{getContrasts}} when extracting coefficients. When \code{constrain}
      is left to the default, it can safely be set to \code{FALSE} to allow for performance gains.}
  \item{family}{a specification of the error distribution and link function to be used in the model.
      This can be a character string naming a family function; a family function, or the result of
      a call to a family function. See \code{\link{family}} details of family functions.}
  \item{tolerance}{ a positive numeric value specifying the tolerance level for
     convergence; higher values will speed up the fitting process, but beware of numerical
     instability of estimated scores!}
  \item{iterMax}{ a positive integer specifying the maximum number of main iterations to perform;
     consider raising this value if your model does not converge.}
  \item{trace}{ a logical value indicating whether the deviance
     should be printed after each iteration.}
  \item{verbose}{ a logical value indicating whether progress indicators should be printed,
     including a diagnostic error message if the algorithm restarts.}
  \item{\dots}{ more arguments to be passed to \code{\link{gnm}}}
}
\details{
  The equation of the fitted model is:
  \deqn{ log F_{ijk} = \lambda + \lambda^I_i + \lambda^J_j + \lambda^K_k
                      + \lambda^IK_ik + \lambda^JK_jk
                      + \beta_k \psi^IJ_ij }
  where \eqn{F_ijk} is the frequency observed in the cell at the intersection of row i, column j and
  layer k of \code{tab}. When \code{diagonal = "excluded"}, \eqn{\lambda^IJK_ijk} parameters are added
  but set to 0 when \eqn{i != j} (off-diagonal). When \code{diagonal = "only"}, \eqn{\psi^IJ_ij} is set
  to 0 when \eqn{i != j}.

  Layer coefficients \eqn{\phi_k} are internally exponentiated in the gnm formula, which means the reported
  values are in log scale, with reference 0 for the first year. Interaction coefficients use the
  \dQuote{treatment} contrast, also known as \dQuote{reference} or \dQuote{dummy} coding.

  Actual model fitting is performed using \code{\link{gnm}}, which implements the Newton-Raphson algorithm.
  This function simply allows for direct identification of the log-multiplicative parameters by setting the
  appropriate constraints, and improves performance by eliminating less interesting coefficients.

\value{
  A \code{unidiff} object, with all the components of a \code{\link{gnm}} object, plus an
      \code{unidiff} component holding the most relevant information:
  \item{diagonal}{the value of the \code{diagonal} argument above.}
  \item{layer}{a \code{\link{qvcalc}} object holding the (log) layer coefficients, their standard
      errors and quasi-standard errors.}
  \item{interaction}{a \code{\link{qvcalc}} object holding the two-way interaction coefficients, their
      standard errors and quasi-standard errors.}
